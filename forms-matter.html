            <h1>Forms Matter</h1>
            <p>How the design of forms can decide an election, affect racial profiling and shape identity</p>

            <p>Forms. They’re the often tedious tasks that stand in the way of an online purchase, seeing the doctor or filing your taxes. They may be boring, but they have tremendous power.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re filling out a form or building it yourself, you should be aware that decisions about how to design a form have all kinds of hidden consequences. How you ask a question, the order of questions, the wording and format of the questions, even whether a question is included at all — all affect the final result. Let’s take a look at how.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>How You Ask the Question: The Census</h2>
                <p>The census determines everything from how our congressional districts are drawn to how $400 billion in federal aid is distributed to enforcement of civil rights laws. Perhaps most profoundly, the census gives people the chance to define their identities, communicating how they think about themselves.</p>
                <p>But even small changes in the ways census forms ask questions can have surprising effects, and not just because of <a href="https://emergingus.com/which-box-do-you-check-on-the-census-and-why-bfb5a219cb12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the inherent limitations of asking people to put their identity in a box.</a></p>
                <p>The <a href="https://www.census.gov/population/race/data/MREAD_1790_2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">census has repeatedly changed the way</a> it asks about <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2010/03/03/census-history-counting-hispanics-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">race and Hispanic origin</a>, for example. These are two distinct sections on the census. Between 1990 and 2000, the sequence of these sections was reversed. The 1990 form asked about race first, but the 2000 form asked about Hispanic origin first. Even more notably, the 2000 Census was the first ever to allow Americans to define themselves as members of more than one race.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>These design changes likely altered people’s responses, according to a <a href="https://www.census.gov/pred/www/rpts/AQE%20R&HO%20Final%20Report.pdf">2000 Census report</a> that looked specifically at the new form’s effects. In test questionnaires sent out as part of a national experiment, the number of respondents choosing two or more races doubled once people had an explicit instruction to mark “one or more,” rising from .83 percent in the 1990-style form to 2.03 percent in the 2000-style form. (In the actual 1990 census, someone who filled in more than one race would have had their response edited to choose a single race; the test allowed researchers to see how many people would mark two races despite instructions to mark one.)</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2000/02/15/census/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contrary to what some feared</a>, the change was not enough to substantially reduce the number of people reporting a single race in the five main race categories (White, Black, Asian, American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander). But it did have a large effect on one group: Hispanics.</p>
                <p>Hispanics reporting as “White” went up 10 percentage points between 1990-style and 2000-style form, while reporting as “Some other race” went down by the same amount (overall Hispanic percentage of the population stayed the same). <a href="https://www.census.gov/pred/www/rpts/AQE%20R&HO%20Final%20Report.pdf">The report notes</a> that this jump “probably reflects the effect of the new “one or more” option and the reversed item sequence …” and warns that “these questionnaire effects may mask true population changes, or may masquerade as change when none has occurred.”</p>

                <h2>The Order of the Questions: The Ballot</h2>
                <p>For further proof that form effects have real consequences, just look at the ballot. The order, format and wording of questions on the ballot can (and have many times in the past) influenced how votes are cast.</p>
                <p>I’ve <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/disenfranchised-by-bad-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">written about ballot design in the past</a>, and you can read much more about the impacts of unclear instructions ...</p>

                <p>... and how missing column headers or ballots that span two pages can lead to errors and people’s votes being tossed.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>But I want to highlight a design decision that seems trivial but in fact has a substantial impact on our selections on the ballot: the order of the candidates’ names. <a href="http://stanford.io/2AwTpHR">Numerous studies</a> have confirmed that the candidate listed first has an advantage. A <a href="http://www.shsu.edu/dpg006/ballot%20order.pdf">recent study of Texas primary and runoff elections</a> attempts to quantify exactly how much. Ballot order is randomized within each of Texas’ 254 counties, so it’s possible to compare the results of federal, state or judicial races across them all. Darren Grant, the author of the study and an economics professor at Sam Houston State University, found that “the ballot order effect is huge.” Having your name listed first versus last can swing the race as much as 10 percentage points, especially in less high-profile races further down the ballot. Many elections have been determined by a smaller margin of victory than that.</p>
                <p>If the order of questions on a form can affect <em>who you vote for</em>, just think of how it might influence other decisions.</p>

                <h2>How Easy It Is to Answer the Question: Encouraging Enrollment</h2>
                <p>It’s well-known that many kids who graduate high school and plan on going to college don’t show up in the fall (about 10 percent to 40 percent <a href="https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/files/cepr-sdp/files/sdp-summer-melt-handbook.pdf">according to research from Harvard</a>). This phenomenon, known as “summer melt,” was the subject of a recent episode of <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537740926/why-arent-students-showing-up-for-college" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR’s Hidden Brain podcast</a>. The episode described how the drop-off rates are much higher for students who come from lower-income families and those who are the first in their family to go to college.</p>
                <p>Surprisingly, researchers have found that one of the biggest reasons for this drop-off is not a lack of money, or a sudden change in circumstances, or a change of heart. It’s forms — specifically, how these students struggle to fill out the vast number of forms required to satisfy schools: the FAFSA, transcript requests, health forms, etc.</p>
                <p>The admissions office at Georgia State University noticed more and more of its accepted students falling off at some point in the enrollment process. At its height, this number reached 18 percent of students. School officials suspected the massive amount of required paperwork might have something to do with it.</p>
                <p>Their relatively simple intervention? <a href="http://bit.ly/2BsHgAv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An artificially intelligent chatbot nicknamed “Pounce,”</a> after the school’s mascot. The chatbot interacted with students via text message in real time to answer common questions. <em>When is my transcript due? How do I send in my FAFSA?</em> The first summer using the chatbot, 300 more students enrolled than the previous year, and summer melt dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent.</p>
                <p>In this case, making the form-filling process less cumbersome and intimidating had an undeniably positive effect. Businesses, too, use the design of forms to grease the wheels, to get people through the boring/painful parts as fast as possible. Online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook depend on their users posting, tweeting, liking and messaging as much and as quickly as possible, so they have every incentive to design forms that get users from beginning to end in record time.</p>
                <p>But sometimes designers actually want to slow users down. So they add a little friction to the process, making it <em>harder</em> to answer the questions on a form.</p>
